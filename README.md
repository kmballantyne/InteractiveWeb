Here is the link to view the live website https://chicago-vet-insurance.netlify.app/

This is an interactive website that looks at the distribution of health insurance coverage for people with veteran status in Chicago.

The three visualizations should include the following:
- A chloropleth map of Chicago with a tooltip interactivity
- A histogram of the percentage of civilians in Chicago that are active military or veterans
- A histogram of the percentage of residents in Chicago that do not have health insurance
- A scatter plot of the percentage of civilians in Chicago that are active military or veterans versus the percentage of residents in Chicago that do not have health insurance.
